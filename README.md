# StellarStay Reservations API

Description
-----------

The **StellarStay Reservations API** is a hotel reservation management system. It allows users to check available rooms, create reservations, retrieve details of specific reservations, cancel reservations, and list all reservations. The system includes dynamic pricing rules, such as adjustments for the number of days, weekends, and additional options like breakfast.

Technologies Used
-----------------

-   **.NET Core 8** - Framework for building the API.
-   **Entity Framework Core** - ORM for interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
-   **PostgreSQL** - Database for storing reservation and room information.
-   **Swagger** - Interactive API documentation.
-   **xUnit** - Testing framework for unit tests.
-   **Moq** - Library for creating mock objects in tests.

Installation and Setup
----------------------

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash

    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/StellarStayReservationsAPI.git
    cd StellarStayReservationsAPI`

2.  **Database Setup**:

    Ensure that PostgreSQL is installed and running. Create a database for the API and update the connection string in `appsettings.json`:

    ```bash
    json

    `"ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=stellarstaydb;Username=your_user;Password=your_password"
    }`

3.  **Apply Migrations**:

    Apply the migrations to create the necessary tables in the database:

    ```bash   

    `dotnet ef database update`

4.  **Run the Application**:

    Start the API by running:

    ```bash   

    `dotnet run`

    The API will be available at `https://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5000`.

5.  **Access Swagger**:

    To explore the interactive API documentation, navigate to `https://localhost:5001/swagger` or `http://localhost:5000/swagger`.
